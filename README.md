# AwSW-A-Trip-to-the-Woods

This mod requires MagmaLink on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jakzie2/awsw-magmalink) or the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2594080243), [Evil Chaos Knight’s Core mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1405536097&searchtext=), and [Not-So-Tragic Hero](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1405568582&searchtext=) to function.

In Anna’s fourth date, she mentions that for a vacation she just walked into the woods in a random direction for a week. 
Now, you can join her, and go on a similar vacation together.

This mod is set at some point in time after ending [D] of Not-So-Tragic Hero.
This mod wasn’t designed to be a sequal or continuation, it’s just using NSTH as context.
It’s highly recommended that you have played through NSTH before playing this mod.

How to start the mod:
Play through Not-So-Tragic Hero, and get the [D] ending. The mod will start automatically after.
Or:
Install my utility mod, Mod Conflict Avoidance, and get Anna’s good ending. Then choose: “A Trip to the Woods.”
